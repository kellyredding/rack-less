= Rack::Less

== Description

A better way to use LESS CSS in Ruby web apps.

* Update: rack-less as of v3.x.x \ uses the latest version of the ruby less parser, https://github.com/cowboyd/less.rb (based on less.js).  To use the older ruby based parse, require rack-less ~> 2.0.

== Installation

    $ gem install rack-less

== Basic Usage

Rack::Less is implemented as a piece of Rack middleware and can be used with
any Rack-based application. If your application includes a rackup (`.ru`) file
or uses Rack::Builder to construct the application pipeline, simply require
and use as follows:

    require 'rack/less'

    # optional - use as necessary
    Rack::Less.configure do |config|
      config.compress = true
      # other configs ...
    end

    use Rack::Less,
      :source    => 'app/less',
      :hosted_at => '/'
      # additional options ...

    run app

== Using with Rails

Add this to your environment files (development.rb, production.rb, test.rb) located under `config/environments/`:

    config.middleware.use "Rack::Less"

Add any configs in an initializer (optional - use as necessary):

    Rack::Less.configure do |config|
      # for example
      config.cache = Rails.configuration.action_controller.perform_caching
      if Rails.env.development?
        config.cache_bust = true
      end
    end

You should now see `Rack::Less` listed in the middleware pipeline:

    rake middleware

== Available Configurations

* .*cache* [false]
  - Whether to cache the compilation output to a corresponding static file

* .*compress* [false]
  - Whether or not to apply compression to the concatenation output
    - :*yui* - use YUI Compressor (gem install yui-compressor)
    - :*whitespace* - remove extraneous whitespace only.

* .*combinations* [{}]
  - Directives for combining the output of many stylesheets and serving them as a single resource.

* .*cache_bust* [nil]
  - Directives for timestamping (cache-busting) stylesheet references
    - :*false* - don't explicitly cache bust (no value added)
    - :*true* - use Time.now.to_i as the explicit value (will never cache)
    - :*nil* - change cache bust value if the file is modified (similar to Rails' stylesheet_link_tag)
    - :*<any other value>* - add the value as "foo.css?<value>"

== Available Options

* :*root* ["."]
  - The app root.  The reference point for the source and public options.

* :*source* ['app/stylesheets']
  - The path (relative to the root) where LESS source files are located

* :*public* ['public']
  - The path where static files are located

* :*hosted_at* ['/stylesheets']
  - The public HTTP path for hosted stylesheets.

== Using in layouts

=== Cache Busting

Rails does a lot of helpful things with 'stylesheet_link_tag' to help reference your stylesheets into your layouts - things like cache busting stylesheet hrefs.  However, Rails' will only cache bust your stylesheets if the file exists in the public/stylesheets directory.  When using Rack::Less a file may never exist at that path or, when caching is used, only exist after the initial request.

To help provide this behavior, Rack::Less provides a helper for generating reference paths to your stylesheets.

    # equivalent to: stylesheet_link_tag 'reset'
    stylesheet_link_tag Rack::Less.stylesheet('reset')

=== Combinations

At times, it is useful to combine multiple stylesheets and serve them as one resource.  For example you may have two sets of stylesheets: one for traditional web views and one for mobile web views.  Rails' provides the :cache option on 'stylesheet_link_tag' helper to provide this function.

    stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'app_web', :cache => 'web'
    stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'iui', 'app_mobile', :cache => 'mobile'

Rack::Less uses combinations, in conjunction with the :cache config setting, to provide this function.  Combinations are configured using a hash, where the key is the resource name and the value is an array of names corresponding to stylesheets to combine as the named resource.  For the above example, use a configuration like this:

    Rack::Less.configure do |config|
      config.combinations = {
        'web' => ['reset', 'common', 'app_web'],
        'mobile' => ['reset', 'common', 'iui', 'app_mobile']
      }
    end

and stylesheet link tags like this:

    # equivalent to: stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'app_web'
    stylesheet_link_tag Rack::Less.stylesheet('web')

    # equivalent to: stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'iui', 'app_mobile'
    stylesheet_link_tag Rack::Less.stylesheet('mobile')

If you configure Rack::Less to cache, with something like this:

    Rack::Less.config.cache = true

then the same stylesheet link tags behave like they have the :cache option set, respectively:

    # equivalent to: stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'app_web', :cache => 'web'
    stylesheet_link_tag Rack::Less.stylesheet('web')

    # equivalent to: stylesheet_link_tag 'reset', 'common', 'iui', 'app_mobile', :cache => 'mobile'
    stylesheet_link_tag Rack::Less.stylesheet('mobile')
